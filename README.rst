Django signals cloudevents
=====

This apps allow you to produce `Clouevents <https://cloudevents.io/>`_ starting from your models signals sending them to a configurable url (sink).

This app is mainly intended to transform a Django instance into a Knative source for your [KRules](https://github.com/airspot-dev/krules) application, 
through a SinkBinding or ContainerSource.

For more information visit the `Knative eventing documentation <https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/>`_

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "django_signals_cloudevents" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'django_signals_cloudevents',
    ]

2. Register your models like this::

    from django_signals_cloudevents import send_cloudevent

    post_save.connect(send_cloudevent, sender=YourModel)

3. [Optional] As said previously, by default this app is configured to be used with a SinkBinding and get sink url from the environment variable K_SINK and the source name from K_SOURCE.
It is possible to override the chosen env variable in your project settings, here is the default configuration::

    CLOUDEVENTS_ENV = {
        "SINK_VAR": "K_SINK",
        "SOURCE_VAR": "K_SOURCE"
    }
